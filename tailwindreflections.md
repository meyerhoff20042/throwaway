# Tailwind CSS Reflections

## Core Concepts

* I enjoy the idea of using pre-existing classes in HTML. For some of my websites in CIS-174 last semester, I noticed that my CSS page was getting pretty long once it was all said and done. I think being able to
  contain most of the repetitive and tedious work within the div tag will make my traditional CSS coding experience much easier.
* I can see myself using the utility-first approach in many different projects as it is more convenient than writing traditional CSS code. Learning how to write the complex inline styles will take me a minute,
  but I hope that after I gain a basic understanding of them I'll be able to apply them in different, creative ways.
* My experience with `hover`, `focus`, and other pseudo-classes is fairly limited. I used them in a recent website for CIS-176 Web Fundamentals II, where I was required to use 10 new CSS tricks that I could find.
  I believe using Tailwind would help me apply more pseudo-classes as it's easier to add them using their software. I can include them in an inline style as opposed to writing new elements on my CSS file.
* Looking at the Hover, Focus, and Other States page, I see what you mean by how extensive it is. CSS can be a powerful tool when used to its full potential, and Tailwind can help do most of the heavy lifting for you.
* Responsive design was something I struggled with last semester. I think having it written in my HTML code can help me gain a better understanding of how to use it. I still have some work to do to understand the
  elements involved in responsive design but I think Tailwind can help me organize my HTML and CSS stylings when doing so.
