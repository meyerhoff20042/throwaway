# Tailwind CSS Reflections

## Core Concepts

* I enjoy the idea of using pre-existing classes in HTML. For some of my websites in CIS-174 last semester, I noticed that my CSS page was getting pretty long once it was all said and done. I think being able to
  contain most of the repetitive and tedious work within the div tag will make my traditional CSS coding experience much easier.
* I can see myself using the utility-first approach in many different projects as it is more convenient than writing traditional CSS code. Learning how to write the complex inline styles will take me a minute,
  but I hope that after I gain a basic understanding of them I'll be able to apply them in different, creative ways.
* My experience with `hover`, `focus`, and other pseudo-classes is fairly limited. I used them in a recent website for CIS-176 Web Fundamentals II, where I was required to use 10 new CSS tricks that I could find.
  I believe using Tailwind would help me apply more pseudo-classes as it's easier to add them using their software. I can include them in an inline style as opposed to writing new elements on my CSS file.
* Looking at the Hover, Focus, and Other States page, I see what you mean by how extensive it is. CSS can be a powerful tool when used to its full potential, and Tailwind can help do most of the heavy lifting for you.
* Responsive design was something I struggled with last semester. I think having it written in my HTML code can help me gain a better understanding of how to use it. I still have some work to do to understand the
  elements involved in responsive design but I think Tailwind can help me organize my HTML and CSS stylings when doing so.

## Example Classes

#### Columns
* I last used columns in web design when we started working with tables in CIS-174 last semester. However, I didn't apply a whole lot of extra styling to them outside of padding and size. Using Tailwind's styling system should
  help me expand my horizons the next time I find myself needing columns on one of my web pages.

#### Align Self
* The `align` class is one of my most commonly used ones in CSS. Most times, I used it to line items in the center of the page; however, I had a few instances where blocks of text or other content needed to be on a specific side
  of its div. While I already use this class extensively, applying it to my HTML code can help ensure I am using it correctly. It would also be interesting to see how aligning items within a pseudo-class such as `hover` would look.

#### Transforms
* I like the way Tailwind combines a lot of the classes under this category as inline tags. I don't think I've used any transformation classes in my web development class, but Tailwind makes it look pretty easy.

#### Scroll Snap
* I haven't used any `scroll-snap` classes yet, but they look very useful in certain situations. The versatility when using scroll snap makes it a great option for any situation where the developer wishes to push the user to
  look at a certain image or control.

#### Dark Mode
* I have Dark Mode enabled on most of the sites I frequent, so I imagine I'll want to implement it in my projects pretty soon. When I first thought about it, Dark Mode seemed like a feature that would require tons of extra code
  as you would have to modify each element in your page to fit the theme. However, knowing that it can be enabled through a few inline tags using Tailwind it seems a lot more feasible than I once thought.

#### Plugins
* I don't have any experience coding with JavaScript yet. However, when skimming through the Plugins page on Tailwind Docs, it looks as though Tailwind and JavaScript can go hand-in-hand in creating a fantastic web experience.
  On its own, Tailwind has a lot of different options for developers; adding plugins with new styles allows for maximum creativity in web design.

#### Z-Index
* When I first saw Z-Index as a page on the sidebar, I thought it was referring to some kind of revolutionary 3D web design. However, reading through the page made it obvious what it was talking about and it still looks appealing.
  While not the three dimensions I had in mind, using the Z-Index when certain elements are sharing space allows for the developer to push the important ones to the front, similar to PowerPoint.

#### Flex
* The flexing options CSS gives you are such an important part of styling a website. Allowing your web pages to reorganize themselves to best fit the device's screen is an essential component of creating an enjoyable web experience.
  Being able to do this using Tailwind will let developers describe exactly how the website will look in most circumstances, including what is expanded or shrunk to fit the picture. This can already be done in CSS, but allowing it
  to be done in inline tags leaves a relatively clean CSS file for other uses.

## Applications from the Syntax Episode

* The Syntax episode I listened to talks about a lot of different units used in CSS. Ranging from common ones like rem to some of the more obscure ones out there, they discussed how these different units can be applied in different
  ways and how the consensus on certain common ones has changed. They also spent a portion of the episode discussing Flexboxes and how they are unitless in usage.
* When reading through some of the Tailwind Docs, I noticed how many of the classes can rely on a multitude of CSS units. The ones I saw most often were pixels and rems, but I saw many different units of measurement pop up as I
  skimmed through the examples. It's apparent that many of these CSS classes are relatively flexible when it comes to units used, and it's up to the developer to determine which one is best for their website.
* Flexboxes in CSS are more relative than exact with their measurements. How items adjust when a flex class is applied depends on the circumstance, and (in my experience) a lot of the time the items may not do what you want them to.
  I looked through some of the Flexbox pages in the Tailwind Docs, and the examples show that they are different than many other CSS classes. Instead of using common units such as pixels or ems, many of the Flexbox tags use 1s and 0s,
  percentages, and certain words like "auto" to demonstrate them.

## The Underlying CSS

* When I write my CSS files, I usually begin working on them after I've written most of my HTML code. I'm not the best at CSS so I like to see how the web page looks after I've added something to see if it creates the effect I want.
  That being said, many of the inline tags in the Tailwind Docs make it clear what is happening within the tag, even if it's hidden behind abbreviations and other keywords. While I've still got some work to do learning the keywords in
  CSS and with inline tags, I think Tailwind does a good job letting div classes be customizable while also being concise, even if it looks a bit messy.
* Tailwind seems like a very useful application for web developers and I plan on using it for my future projects. I'm still learning about a lot of CSS features so I'm hoping Tailwind helps me gain a better understanding of how they affect
  your HTML code as it's written right alongside it. I can definitely see myself refactoring some of my messier CSS classes and reapplying them within my HTML code using inline tags, leaving me a much cleaner state in the CSS file.
