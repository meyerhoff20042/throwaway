# Thoughts on First-Class Functions

* JavaScript is definitely more flexible with functions than languages that I've worked with in the past. Being able to treat a function like any other variable allows for seemingly limitless possibilities
  and I'm sure I'll get to see some cool implications of this as I continue learning JavaScript.
* I think being able to declare functions within functions and use them as return variables is a neat feature. It'll take a while for me to get comfortable with these applications of functions but I think I can
  get the hang of it after enough practice.
* If I had to compare JavaScript functions to something, I'd probably use some of my C# applications. There have been several cases where I created a function within another function, usually to prevent repeated
  code. I haven't tried using functions as parameters but I'm not sure if C# would let me do that.
