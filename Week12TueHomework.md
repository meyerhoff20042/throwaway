# Thoughts on Passing Variables in JavaScript

* JavaScript is the first language I've seen where mutating variables is discouraged, but it's cool to see the ways to work around that. It was definitely confusing at first learning
  the differences between passing by copy, value, and reference, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
* If I had to explain it to someone else, I would probably use your analogy with the TVs and remotes. That made it easier for me to understand and I think it would help others too.
