# BOM and DOM Demos

* This is our first taste of using JavaScript in the browser this semester and I can see how the fundamentals we've learned in previous weeks apply here.
* I think it's cool that every item in the webpage is treated as an object in JavaScript as that should make writing JavaScript in the browser more straightforward than I thought.
* I've went into the Inspect Element in the past and changed text for fun, but it's cool to see how by using the `document.querySelector` method, you can access the properties of controls within the page and edit them.
* I'm looking forward to using JavaScript in web projects and seeing what we can do that can't be done with just HTML and CSS.
