# Browser Template Repo

* I'm glad to see that we're finally moving back to the browser and I'm looking forward to applying JavaScript to web projects.
* I didn't know about the `import` and `export` keywords before watching these videos and I think they'll be really handy when we're organizing our code. In previous coding projects, my method of importing arrays/lists into my code
  was listing the contents on a text file and using `StreamReader` variables to load the information into lists on C#.
* I'll definitely need to learn more about ESM standards. I've been incorporating some basic JavaScript into a client website in CIS-176 Web Fundamentals II and it's a mess right now. I hope applying some of the ESM principles can
  help my code look cleaner for the professor and make the website cleaner for the client.
