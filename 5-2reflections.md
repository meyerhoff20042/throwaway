## Introduction from _Eloquent JavaScript_

### Summary

* Computers are machinery that must be told what to do precisely step-by-step. This tedious process is where _programming_ steps in. Many languages are used to write programs; the one discussed in this section is JavaScript.
* Programming can be difficult to understand; you mustn't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them.
* Programming languages help make computer instructions understandable to humans. In the reading, they reduced a large series of binary codes to a single line of JavaScript combining several methods.
* JavaScript was introduced in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator browser and has since been applied almost universally amongst web browsers. While similar in name to another programming language, Java, they have no relation.
   * A flexible language, JavaScript can accept many different inputs. This has a two-fold effect of being an easy language for beginners while also being harder to debug. This flexibility also allows for a wide range of applications.

### Reflections

* I have taken several web development classes in both high school and college, but I haven't touched JavaScript yet. I (along with many others) used to think it was related to Java somehow and was some sort of web counterpart for it (I didn't really know).
  Learning JavaScript is what I'm most looking forward to in this class, as while I have limited experience with HTML and CSS, JavaScript seems to offer the most capabilities among the three languages.
* I didn't realize how old some of these languages are when I first started coding classes. I knew they'd been around a while, but I didn't think the languages used today originated in the 20th century.

### What is JavaScript?

* JavaScript allows for more complex interactions on web pages, including animations, buttons, popup menus, etc.
* The language has client-side and server-side extensions, allowing the developer to add complex features to the website and help applications connect to underlying databases, respectively.

### JavaScript and Java

* JavaScript and Java have some similarities and major differences. Although JavaScript resembles Java, it differs in several ways:
  * JavaScript supports a runtime system based on data types representing different values.
  * It has a prototype-based object model as opposed to the class-based model.
  * It also supports functions without special declarative requirements.
* JavaScript is a more liberal version of Java. You don't have to declare all variables and classes you use in your program, nor specify if those objects are public or private. Generally speaking, Java is more complex than JavaScript.

### JavaScript and the ECMAScript specification

* ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) supports a standardized version of JavaScript, appropriately named ECMAScript. This version is supported internationally and behaves the same in all supporting applications.
  * The standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization).
* ECMAScript has a set of requirements and is useful for implementing language features that are widely supported. It is not designed to help JavaScript programmers; that is what the JavaScript documentation is for.

### Reflections

* I think using JavaScript would allow me to create more customized, complex websites that fit my needs. Although HTML and CSS offer many features when building a website, JavaScript can bring that site to life in a way.
* Writing ECMA-acceptable JavaScript would be a useful tool to learn when creating websites for international organizations. ECMAScript would also be a safe way of writing code that will work for many different browsers.
