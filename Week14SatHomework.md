# `.sort` vs. `.toSorted`

* The `.sort` and `.toSorted` methods are two ways of sorting elements in an array. However, they do it in two different ways.
* Using `.sort()` on an array will sort the elements **in place**, meaning it mutates and returns the original array.
* Alternatively, `.toSorted()` will return a new array with the elements of the old array but sorted. This is a way to sort the elements without having to mutate the original array.
