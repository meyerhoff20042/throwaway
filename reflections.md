# Reflections

## Terminal

* The terminal is an alternative way of interacting with GitHub repositories (as opposed to the GUI)
* While anything in the GUI can also be done in the terminal, the opposite is not quite true

### Commands

* Several commands can be used to navigate and view your files. Some basic ones include `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`.
  * `cd` can be used in several different ways. You can enter a folder by passing the folder name as an argument. Using `cd ..` returns to the parent folder.
  * `pwd` is used to view the pathway of the current folder.
  * `ls` lists all the contents of the folder. Using `ls -a` will also show any hidden files.

## Git and GitHub

### GitHub

* **GitHub** is a Microsoft-owned platform developers use to cooperate on coding projects.
* Users create repositories that allow them to publish code to their profile. Other users can view their work, make comments, and offer suggestions called **pull requests**.
* GitHub's features allow better cooperation and communication for developers. The ability to comment on someone's work and separate changes with branches allows for
more organization, which is especially helpful in larger projects.  

### Git

* **Git** is a version control system that can be installed on your computer's terminal.
* Git allows you to clone GitHub repositories to your system. From there, you can make changes and use `git push` to send them back to the origin.

## Utilizing These Tools

* The services provided by both Git and GitHub are great for larger teams working on huge projects.
* GitHub has many features to help teams cooperate. For example, users can comment almost anywhere on someone's work, including specific lines of code.
* You can use Git to clone a repository on your device to make changes. This allows you to work in Visual Studio Code and to view the project through your system's file explorer.
