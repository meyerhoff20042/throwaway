# Thoughts on Closures

* The solution code presented in the video is fairly similar to mine. Our functions were used to produce other functions, but yours used arrow notation and I used another `function` keyword. I also made separate functions for
  the different ways of scoring in American football: touchdown (6 points), field goal (3 points), safety/2-pt conversion (2 points), and extra point (1 point). (NOTE: Touchdowns are followed by extra point or 2-point conversion attempts.)
* I liked the use of arrow notation in your video as I think it simplified the parent function. I have a knack for overcomplicating things and this assignment was no different, but I can definitely see myself using arrow notation
  more in the future.

# Thoughts on `map`

* The `map` function seems like a very powerful function with a lot of applications. The ability to apply a function to each element in an array is a central part of working with them. In other languages, I've worked with, such as C#
  and Java, this had to be done using either a `foreach` loop or an enhanced `for` loop, respectively. I like how we can do this same thing in one line of code as opposed to creating an entire loop.
* Previously, when I needed to go through each object in an array, I would create an int `i` and increment by 1 for each index in the array. This can be done with both a `for` loop and a `while` loop, but generally, I prefer
  the `while` loop. However, the `map` method looks incredibly simplistic and will be my main method of iterating through each element in an array going forward.
