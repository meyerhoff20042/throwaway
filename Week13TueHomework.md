# Thoughts on Closures

* The solution code presented in the video is fairly similar to mine. Our functions were used to produce other functions, but yours used arrow notation and I used another `function` keyword. I also made separate functions for
  the different ways of scoring in American football: touchdown (6 points), field goal (3 points), safety/2-pt conversion (2 points), and extra point (1 point). (NOTE: Touchdowns are followed by extra point or 2-pt conversion attempts.)
* I liked the use of arrow notation in your video as I think it simplified the parent function. I have a knack for overcomplicating things and this assignment was no different, but I can definitely see myself using arrow notation
  more in the future.
