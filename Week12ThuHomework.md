# _Eloquent JavaScript_ Reflections

* I thought the idea of **boxing** primitive data types was really interesting. It makes sense now that I think about it, but I thought beforehand that the methods available to us when working with primitive data types
  were just associated with the data type itself, not an extra constructor method.
* I love working with methods in my coding projects and it's cool to see how JavaScript lets you create them wherever. I can imagine it's easier to create methods within object declaration statements as opposed to
  defining them in a separate class file.
* The _call stack_ and _stack overflow_ are terms that I've heard people use ever since I began coding. It's nice to see what those terms mean now and the call stack looks like a nice thing to have in a programming language.
