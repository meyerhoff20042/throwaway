# Homework Review Reflections

## Eloquent JavaScript

### Introduction
* Programming is telling a computer exactly what to do step-by-step.
* Programming is done using programming languages that allow developers to write programs without dealing with the 0s and 1s.
* Programming is tedious and frustrating. A lot of effort is required to learn how to code and apply it in your career.
* Your program can quickly become complex and difficult to understand. Using some of the common practices in coding can allow your programs to remain relatively easy to read for any developer.
* You don't just sit down and start writing code. First, a design has to be created to have some plan and goals.
  * A common way of creating a design is using "pseudocode". While not exactly code itself, it's a more readable version of the code that will be implemented into a program.

### What is JavaScript?
* JavaScript is almost completely unrelated to Java. While slightly similar in syntax, they are two separate languages.
  * _"JavaScript is to Java as ham is to hammock"_ - Manav Misra (2024)
* JavaScript is a very flexible language that can be relatively easy for beginners.
  * However, the flexibility is a double-edged sword. It can lead to code being hard to debug or difficult for other developers to understand. Thus, it's important to follow common practices (especially when getting started!).
 
### Mozilla Web Docs
* JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language, not just object-oriented.
* This class will mainly focus on _client-side_ JavaScript.
* ECMAScript helps standardize JavaScript.

## Reflections

* I'm looking forward to learning JavaScript as I think that will help me push my web development skills to their full potential. Knowing the triad of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an important key to making a career in software development
  (especially web development).
* I've always wondered what the difference between Java and JavaScript is. I didn't realize they were two completely separate things; I just thought they were related somehow.
