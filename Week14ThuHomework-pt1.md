# '.filter' method in JavaScript

* I think the `.filter` method is pretty self-explanatory. In the past, I've filtered items in arrays by length, index, value, and if it contains a certain character or substring.
* That being said, I'm still getting used to the arrow syntax in JavaScript. I understand what it does, but it was interesting to see how it was used within the `.filter` method.
* Overall, I think this is a pretty handy tool to have when handling arrays and I can see many uses for it when working on projects using JavaScript.
