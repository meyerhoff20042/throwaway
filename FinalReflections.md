# React Reflections

* When you were describing the main features of React, I imagined it as a JavaScript version of Tailwind to a certain extent. Instead of having separate files for two different languages,
  you are able to embed bits and pieces of HTML into a `js` file to affect them more directly.
* Looking through some of the React docs, I found several different implementations of JS concepts that we learned in the class. In the "Responding to Events" section under "**Adding Interactivity**",
  the docs show examples of buttons added using JS. This can be done using either `return` keywords or arrow notation.
* Different HTML elements can be rendered through React as well, such as Lists (shown in "Rendering Lists" under "**Describing the UI**"). Rendering a list in JS is pretty straightforward; you only
  need to use an array and the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.
* I can see a lot of situations where React would be handy. Any website that requires a lot of user interaction could use React to simplify the JavaScript code. Search functions are greatly simplified
  with the React library, and it's easier to implement JS functions into HTML elements with React as well.
