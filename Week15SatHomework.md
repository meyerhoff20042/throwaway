# Test Driven Development Reflections

* I think the videos this week were very informative and showed us a good example of using test-driven development to write our functions. Most of my coding experience has been through trial and error so it's good
  to see that JavaScript has a way to apply that philosophy.
* I can understand why the `reduce` method is considered the most powerful array method in JavaScript. Whether it's being used to merge two arrays or to add all the values in an array, it can be used in multiple
  ways and without it, doing tasks like the one in this assignment requires a more complicated setup.
* I liked the use of the `describe` keyword to test functions as that seems like a much better testing method than just using `test`. By being able to fit more cases into the test file, the functions in your library
  can be built to handle many different types of situations.
* The `describe` keyword is extra handy when Copilot is able to almost seamlessly generate the tests for you, like it did in the videos. Hopefully I'll have that working for CIS-277 next semester.
